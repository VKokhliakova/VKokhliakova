## Hi there, I am Viktoria Kokhliakova ðŸ‘‹

## I am Data Analyst with engineering background.

Working with data has always been the area of my interest and for the last couple of years it was the favorite part of my job.
Finding correlations between different parameters, deriving insights based on those correlations and suggesting to business data-driven decisions gives me the feeling of satisfaction and the feeling I can improve the things around.
